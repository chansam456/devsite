## Inspiration

This site is partially based off of Cixin Liu's sci-fi supspense novel, The Three Body Problem, which I strongly suggest reading.\
My current favorite sci-fi novel. This trilogy has a fascinating and devastating story about humanity's contact with an alien civilization who thinks, acts, and decides differently than us.\ 
I also highly recommend watching the show (Available on Netflix).
